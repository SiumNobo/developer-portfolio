        <h3>The Nature Lover</h3>
        <p>Nature is made of everything we see around us – trees, flowers, plants, animals, sky, mountains, 
        forests and more. Human beings depend on nature to stay alive. Nature helps us breathe,
         gives us food, water, shelter, medicines, and clothes. We find many colors in nature which make the Earth beautiful.</p>

            <p> The thing that makes you a true traveller is the partaking and immersing yourself in whatever part of the world you find yourself in. The traveller are the people who eat the local foods, are always thirsty to see the sights, meet
                 the people and always come back home thirsty for more.</p>

            <p>Domestic and international trips are slightly different. This is because travelling to another country often means you don’t have the same kind of financial, medical, or other types of support available to you in your home country.

                Throughout our lives, people have thought that because we keep traveling and searching for new things to do, we are not focused. They have often thought we were flaky or unfocused. But travel helped us find our purpose and put focus into our lives. The more we got lost in our travels, the richer our lives became.
